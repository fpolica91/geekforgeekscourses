### Clarifications 
  these assholes wrote a confusing problem description
  the provided array are not neccesarily the nodes 
  of the tree, they are the order of hierarchy of employees in a company
        5 -> number of employes in the company
        1 1 2 3 -> employee 1 is the boss of employee 2 and 3
        1 1 2 3 -> employee 2 is the boss of employee 3
        1 1 2 3 -> employee 3 is not a boss
