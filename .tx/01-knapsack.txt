/* Here is the explanation for the code above:
1. We have the items which have values and weights.
2. We have the total weight of the knapsack.
3. We are considering the items one by one.
4. We find the maximum value which can be achieved by considering the current item.
5. We find the maximum value which can be achieved by ignoring the current item.
6. We take the maximum of the two values: considering the current item or ignoring the current item.
7. We return the maximum value. */
