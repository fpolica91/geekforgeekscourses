/* The code above does the following:
1. Initializes the low and high values to the speed limit.
2. Loops until the low value is less than or equal to the high value.
3. At each iteration, calculates the time at which the bike can reach the speed limit.
4. Checks if the speed of the bike at the given time exceeds the maximum allowed speed.
5. If it does, the time is stored in the minimum time to alarm variable.
6. If the speed of the bike at the given time does not exceed the maximum allowed speed, the low value is incremented by 1.
7. If the speed of the bike at the given time exceeds the maximum allowed speed, the high value is decremented by 1.
8. The loop is repeated until the low value is less than or equal to the high value.
9. The minimum time to alarm is printed. */
